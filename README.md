# Linear-Regression-and-Modeling-Data-Movies-with-R-
Your boss has just acquired data about how much audiences and critics like movies as well as numerous other variables about the movies. This dataset is provided below, and it includes information from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB for a random sample of movies.

She is interested in learning what attributes make a movie popular. She is also interested in learning something new about movies. She wants you team to figure it all out.

As part of this project you will complete exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and prediction.

All analysis must be completed using the R programming language via RStudio, and your write up must be an R Markdown document. To help you get started we provide a template Rmd file below (see Rmd template in the Required files section below). Download this file, and fill in each section.

IMPORTANT: Analyses completed using software other than R, or not written up using R Markdown, will receive a 0 on the project regardless of their content.
